## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Basic understanding of workflow automation
- API credentials for services you want to integrate

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-workflows.git
   cd n8n-workflows
   ```

2. **Import workflows to n8n**
   - Open your n8n instance
   - Click "Workflows" ‚Üí "Import from File"
   - Select the desired `.json` workflow file
   - Configure credentials and parameters

3. **Configure credentials**
   - Navigate to "Credentials" in n8n
   - Add required API keys and authentication
   - Test connections before activating workflows

### First Workflow in 5 Minutes

Let's create a simple but powerful workflow:

**Example: Webhook to Slack Notification**

```json
{
  "name": "Webhook to Slack Alert",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "Webhook",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.webhook",
      "position": [250, 300],
      "webhookId": "unique-webhook-id",
      "parameters": {
        "httpMethod": "POST",
        "path": "alert",
        "responseMode": "onReceived"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Slack",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.slack",
      "position": [450, 300],
      "parameters": {
        "resource": "message",
        "operation": "post",
        "channel": "#alerts",
        "text": "üö® Alert: {{$json.message}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": {
    "Webhook": {
      "main": [[{"node": "Slack", "type": "main", "index": 0}]]
    }
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n.com/webhook/alert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Server CPU usage exceeded 90%"}'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Workflow Design Principles

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with core functionality
   - Add complexity incrementally
   - Test each node thoroughly

2. **Error Handling**
   ```json
   {
     "continueOnFail": true,
     "retryOnFail": true,
     "maxTries": 3,
     "waitBetweenTries": 1000
   }
   ```

3. **Security First**
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Use environment variables
   - Implement webhook authentication
   - Validate all inputs

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use pagination for large datasets
   - Implement caching where possible
   - Limit parallel executions
   - Monitor execution times

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clear node naming conventions
   - Add notes and documentation
   - Version control your workflows
   - Regular testing and updates

### Common Patterns

**Rate Limiting:**
```javascript
// In a Function node
const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
await delay(1000); // Wait 1 second between requests
return items;
```

**Data Transformation:**
```javascript
// Transform API response
return items.map(item => ({
  id: item.id,
  name: item.full_name,
  email: item.contact_email,
  tags: item.labels.map(l => l.name)
}));
```

**Conditional Routing:**
```javascript
// Route based on data
if ($json.priority === 'high') {
  return [0]; // Route to first output
} else {
  return [1]; // Route to second output
}
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Debugging Workflows
1. Enable "Execute Workflow" mode for step-by-step testing
2. Use "Sticky Note" nodes for documentation
3. Check execution logs in the workflow history
4. Use "IF" nodes to add debug logging

### Performance Tuning
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple items in a single execution
- **Async Processing**: Use webhooks for long-running tasks
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data temporarily
- **Queue Management**: Implement rate limiting for API calls
